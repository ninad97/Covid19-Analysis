The result of this analysis is every goverment should consider the actual situation which is going on in the world instead of doing politics for which country is getting more vaccines. Everyone should be aware of the situation as we saw in the case of Mongolia, even when more than 50% of residents of the country were vaccinated, The new cases are maximum in Mongolia. So everyone should follow standard norms like wearing masks and timely use of sanitizers.
